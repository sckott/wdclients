# HTTP

Hypertext Transer Protocol, or HTTP, is an application protocol for
data transfer, and is the foundation of data communication for the
World Wide Web.

## HTTP/2

[HTTP/2][http2wiki] (see also [https://http2.github.io/](https://http2.github.io/))
is the next iteration of the HTTP protocol. It is
born out of the standard created by Google called [SPDY][spdy].

In practice, HTTP/2 likely won't be widely used for a few years. As of
June 2016, HTTP/2 was [used by 8.2% of all websites][http2usage].
