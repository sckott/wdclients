Both are open source, free and easy to install:  Download and install R, https://www.r-project.org/alt-home/. Download and install RStudio, http://www.rstudio.com/download. Install needed packages (see below).   2.2.1 R packages pkgs &lt;- c(   &quot;jsonlite&quot;, &quot;knitr&quot;, &quot;httr&quot; ) install.packages(pkgs) You’ll also need to install some R packages. An R package is a collection of functions, data, and documentation that extends the capabilities of base R. Using packages is key to the successful use of R. To install all the packages used in this book open RStudio and run: R will download the packages from CRAN and install them in your system library. If you have problems installing, make sure that you are connected to the internet, and that you haven’t blocked https://cran.rstudio.com in your firewall or proxy.

After you have downloaded the packages, you can load any of the packages into your current R session with the library() command, e.g. library(httr) You will need to reload the package every time you start a new R session.    2.3 Acknowledgements xxx   2.4 Colophon This book was built with: devtools::session_info(pkgs) #&gt; Session info -------------------------------------------------------------- #&gt;  setting  value                                       #&gt;  version  R version 3.2.4 Patched (2016-03-16 r70355) #&gt;  system   x86_64, darwin13.4.0                        #&gt;  ui       X11                                         #&gt;  language (EN)                                        #&gt;  collate  en_US.UTF-8                                 #&gt;  tz       America/Los_Angeles                         #&gt;  date     2016-04-04 #&gt; Packages ------------------------------------------------------------------ #&gt;  package  * version date       source         #&gt;  curl       0.9.6   2016-02-17 CRAN (R 3.2.3) #&gt;  digest     0.6.9   2016-01-08 CRAN (R 3.2.3) #&gt;  evaluate   0.8.3   2016-03-05 CRAN (R 3.2.3) #&gt;  formatR    1.3     2016-03-05 CRAN (R 3.2.3) #&gt;  highr      0.5.1   2015-09-18 CRAN (R 3.2.2) #&gt;  httr       1.1.0   2016-01-28 CRAN (R 3.2.3) #&gt;  jsonlite   0.9.19  2015-11-28 CRAN (R 3.2.2) #&gt;  knitr      1.12.3  2016-01-22 CRAN (R 3.2.3) #&gt;  magrittr   1.5     2014-11-22 CRAN (R 3.2.0) #&gt;  markdown   0.7.7   2015-04-22 CRAN (R 3.2.0) #&gt;  mime       0.4     2015-09-03 CRAN (R 3.2.0) #&gt;  openssl    0.9.2   2016-02-26 CRAN (R 3.2.3) #&gt;  R6         2.1.2   2016-01-26 CRAN (R 3.2.3) #&gt;  stringi    1.0-1   2015-10-22 CRAN (R 3.2.2) #&gt;  stringr    1.0.0   2015-04-30 CRAN (R 3.2.0) #&gt;  yaml       2.1.13  2014-06-12 CRAN (R 3.2.0)   "],
